# ráð (Java + Icelandic for "Advice")

**Buckle up, buttercup! You're about to dive into the wondrous world of ráð—a Simple Lisp Interpreter in Java!**

Ever dreamed of writing Lisp with the robust elegance of Java? Neither did we, but we did it anyway. Welcome to ráð, our charming endeavor to blend the symphony of parentheses with Java's structured sophistication.

## What the heck is ráð?

In the land of ice and fire, "ráð" means "advice." And we're here to advise you on the best way to confuse your friends and scare off potential dates: by writing Lisp in Java! Think of it as your quirky Icelandic cousin who just can't stop talking about parentheses.

## Why Would You Do This?

Great question!
- We enjoy Java's type safety and tooling.
- We love Lisp's elegance and parentheses.
- We thought: why not combine them? (After a couple of espressos, it seemed like a brilliant idea.)

## Features

- **Parens Galore**: No Lisp interpreter is complete without an overabundance of parentheses.
- **Revolutionary Advices**: Gain insights and wisdom from our exceptional intertwining of Lisp in Java.
- **100% Icelandic Fun**: Delight in knowing that your code suggestions come from a land where volcanoes are sightseeing landmarks.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: Because who needs social life when you have Git?
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:FredrikMeyer/jrad.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project**: Let Maven (or Gradle, we don’t judge) do the heavy lifting.
   ```sh
   mvn install
   ```

3. **Run It**: Now, sit back and watch the magic unfold (but don't blink, you might miss it).
   ```sh
   java -jar target/rad.jar // TODO
   ```

## Usage

Just type away your Lisp code, and let ráð give you back some Icelandic wisdom along with the result:
```lisp
(+ 1 2)
```
Who knows, you might just solve all the mysteries of the universe. Or not. But hey, at least you tried.

## Contributing

We love contributions! Fork the repo, make your changes, and send us a pull request. Bonus points if you include some Icelandic words.

## License

MIT License. Because we believe in freedom and open source. Just like the Vikings.

## Final Words

May your parentheses be balanced and your Java heap never overflow. Remember, ráð is not just an interpreter; it's a journey into the quirky and beautiful realm of Icelandic Java wisdom.

*Við ráð af Java - Your advice of Java.*

**Note**: No developers were harmed in the making of this interpreter, though many parentheses were sacrificed.
